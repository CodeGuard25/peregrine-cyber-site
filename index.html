  <!-- Mission Statement -->
  <section class="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-6 py-16">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-600 mb-6">Our Mission</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">With over 30 years in IT and cybersecurity, we know how overwhelming security can feel—especially for small businesses without dedicated tech staff. Maybe you’re relying on one person, a managed service provider (MSP), or handling things yourself, and sorting through tools, vendors, and regulations like HIPAA—or whatever applies to your business—feels more confusing than helpful.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">That’s where we come in. We’re your co-pilot, helping you see what’s important, what needs protection—whether that’s patient data, customer information, or your operations—and how to build a security program that fits your business. We use proven security frameworks like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Center for Internet Security (CIS)—but we turn them into plain English and practical steps.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">No tool overload or jargon here. You get clear assessments, realistic recommendations, and a steady partner who coordinates with your team and trusted vendors to make it happen.</p>
    <p class="font-semibold">With Peregrine Cyber, you get more than advice—you get clarity, confidence, and a security program built for your business.</p>
