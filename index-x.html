    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-600 mb-6" style="font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;">Our Mission</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">With over 30 years in IT and cybersecurity, we know how overwhelming security can feel for small businesses—especially without a dedicated tech team. You might rely on one person, an MSP, or handle it yourself, but sorting through tools, vendors, cyber insurance requirements—or whatever applies—can feel more confusing than helpful.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">That’s where we come in. As your cybersecurity advisor, we help you make sense of the chaos—translating industry frameworks like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Center for Internet Security (CIS) into everyday guidance. Together, we’ll build a security program that works for your business, your budget, and your risk appetite.</p>
    <p class="text-center font-semibold mt-2">With Peregrine Cyber, you gain clarity, confidence, and an actionable roadmap—without the jargon.</p>
