  <!-- Mission Statement -->
  <section class="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-6 py-16">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-600 mb-6">Our Mission</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">With over 30 years in IT and cybersecurity, we’ve seen how overwhelming security can be — especially for small businesses without dedicated tech staff. You might be relying on a single person, an outside IT company, or managing it all yourself. Either way, it’s hard to know what you really need when everything sounds complicated or expensive.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">Our job is to simplify that. We help you understand what matters, what you need to protect, and how to do it without wasting money. Whether you’re working in healthcare, handling customer data, or just trying to stay ahead of threats, we make sure you’re covered in a way that fits your business.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">We use trusted standards like NIST and CIS — these are just industry guides that help us figure out the best steps to protect your business. We’ll break them down into plain language and give you a clear path forward.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">We also help you make sense of overlapping tools, confusing vendor advice, and changing cyber insurance requirements. No scare tactics — just straight talk and practical solutions.</p>
    <p class="font-semibold">At the end of the day, cybersecurity isn’t just about trust — it’s about <span class="text-blue-400">trust and verification</span>. We're here to help you feel confident that your business is protected.</p>
